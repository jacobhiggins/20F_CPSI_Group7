'''
The following code evaluates what would likely be the "most comfortable room" for a particular user.
Specifically, the user puts in their ideal temperature and humidity levels.
Then, the code finds the average temperature and humidity over an entire day for each room available in the dataset.
The room that is the closest to this ideal temperature/humidity is counted as the "most comfortable room" for that day.
The code does this for all days in the past year, counting how many times each room is considered "most comfortable."
Finally, the code calculates the frequency that each room is considered ideal as a percentage of the total counts.
The code prints out the three highest rooms that are most frequently the most comfortable, for both temperature and humidity.

An extension of this code could be to construct Pareto frontiers, showing how different rooms can maximize comfort in a variety of different ways.
This code only considers temperature and humidity, but can easily be extended to other observables.
